questinos:
1. How does the resistance value of VR1 affect the motor's speed?
2. How does the resistance value of VR1 affect the current draw of the motor?
3. What happens to the motor's speed and current draw when the resistance value of VR1 is increased?
4. How does this relate to the RC car's speed controller, and how can this concept be applied to control the car's speed?

answers:
1. The resistance value of vr1 effects motor speeds as if the value is more the motor speed decreases and if the value is less the motor
 speed increases

2. If the value is lower the current draw to the motor is more if the value is higher the current draw is less 

3.It decreases 

4. This relates like if the battery voltage os more the current draw will be more hence the speed will be more and if the battery voltage
 is less and the resistance value is higher the current flowing will be less hence the speed will decrease
